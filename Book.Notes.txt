If theoretical science is to be possible at all, then at some level the systems it studies must follow definite rules. Yet in the past throughout the exact sciences it has usually been assumed that those rules must be ones based on traditonal mathematics. But the crucula realization that lead me to develop the new kind of science in this book is that there is in fact no reason to think that systems like those we see in nature should follow only such traditonal mathematical rules.
Earlier in history it might have been difficult to imagine what more general types of rules could be like. But today we are surrounded by computers whose program in effect implemet a huge variety of rules. The programs we use in practice are mostly based on extremely complicated rules specifically designed to perform particular tasks. But a program can in principle follow essentially any definite set of rules. And at the core of the new kind of science that I describe in this book are discoveries I have made about programs with some of the very simples rules that are possible.
